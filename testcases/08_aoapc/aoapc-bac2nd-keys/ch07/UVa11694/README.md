This directory is a Strict SysY testcase converted from the provided C++ solution for UVa 11694 (Gokigen Naname).

Files:
- `testfile.txt`: Strict SysY program (no includes, `int/void` only, 1D arrays only).
- `in.txt`: Newline-separated integer input.
- `ans.txt`: Expected output generated by the skill runner.

I/O encoding:
- Degrees are provided as `(N+1)*(N+1)` integers in row-major order; use `-1` for “no clue”.
- Output prints `N`, then `N*N` integers in row-major order: `1` = `\`, `-1` = `/`, `0` = empty (should not appear for solvable cases).

To regenerate `ans.txt`:
- `python3 /home/tsxb/.codex/skills/create-sysy-testcase/scripts/run_case.py /tmp/sysytest_codex_8rmy8w7x`
