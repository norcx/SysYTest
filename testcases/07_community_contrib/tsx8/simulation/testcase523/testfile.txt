/* Description:
 *   The original C++ source is a Windows-only differential-testing harness that
 *   repeatedly executes external programs via `system()` and compares output
 *   files (`fc`). Strict SysY has no OS/process/file APIs, so the behavior
 *   cannot be represented as a deterministic SysY program.
 *
 *   This testcase is therefore a minimal, valid Strict SysY program with the
 *   same observable I/O behavior (no input, no output) and a normal exit.
